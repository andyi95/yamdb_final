# Yamdb API
## Description

[![Yamdb app workflow](https://github.com/andyi95/yamdb_final/actions/workflows/yamdb_workflow.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/andyi95/yamdb_final/actions/workflows/yamdb_workflow.yaml)

**YAMDB** is an online service, collecting user's reviews for different compositions divided into different categories and genres. There're a few pre-installed set of categories and genres but you may add some custom ones.
The project is built from repo [andyi95/api_yamdb](https://github.com/andyi95/api_yamdb) with CI/CD [GitHubActions](https://github.com/features/actions), Docker and Docker-compose toolset.

Tech stack used in this project: Python3, Django Rest Framework, PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, Docker

## Demo server

A server with deployed and running project can be found by the following URL http://yatube.blackberrystudio.com/. You can read the API online docs [here](http://yatube.blackberrystudio.com/redoc).

## Build and deploy

#### Docker and Docker-compose packages installation
*Applicable for Ubuntu distros, for other operation systems consult the relevant [Docker docs section](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)*

```shell
# Installation of packages used for adding a side-channel Docker repositories
sudo apt update
sudo apt install \
  apt-transport-https \
  ca-certificates \
  curl \
  gnupg-agent \
  software-properties-common -y
# Import Docker GPG keys and add the repo
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
# Docker packages download and install
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-compose -y
```
Restart the server and check if Docker installation passed correctly with following commands: `service docker status` and `docker ps -a`.
 
#### Installation

You may install the project in two ways:

**GitHub Actions**

Using the CI/CD GitHub Actions solution. To deploy fork the original repository to your profile, open Actions Secrets section in the repo settings and add new enviroments according to the list below. Start deploy with allowing Workflow run on the Actions tab.

**Local deployment**

Clone the repository to the deployment server `git clone https://github.com/andyi95/yamdb_final.git`, in the project directory copy the file `.env.sample` to`.env` and fill the variables in it according to the list. Run containers with command `docker-compose up -d`.

Attention! Check that neither PostgreSQL, nor any web-services are running on your host before the deployment, otherwise check the Docker port mapping [guides](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/).

For the proper deployment you need to clone repository, copy `docker-compose.yaml` to the home directory and add following Action Secret keys in repository settings:
  - `SECRET_KEY` - 20-symbols Django key used for generating cookies, crsf and save storages
  - `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`  - PostgreSQL server container's hostname and port. If necessary, you may use PostgreSQL server running on the host - for appropriate network configuration check the [docs section](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/) dedicated to port mapping between containers and host.
  - `DB_NAME`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - database name, PostgreSQL username and password used for save connection.
  - `HOST`, `USER`, `SSH_KEY`/`PASSWORD`, `PASSPHRASE` (optional) - network address, username, private SSH-key (with a passphrase if used) or password, used for SSH deployment with GitHub Actions. Check the official [ssh-action](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action) repo for more parameters.
  - `DB_ENGINE` (optional) - Django library for dabase connection and management. Might be useful in case of using a DB server different from Postgres. Default is `django.db.backends.postgresql`
  - `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_TO` - Telegram bot's token and user id for sending notifications. Check the [Telegram manuals](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) to know more about Telegram bots creation and management.

#### Initial configs

After the tests and deploy have been completed, the initial configurations might be proceeded:
```shell
docker-compose exec web bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
exit
```
The script above indexes static files and set up database fields and relations. Also, a superuser account for admin panel management might be useful:

```shell
docker exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### Common usage and administration

After the containers installation you may consult the Yamdb API documentation by the following address http://localhost/redoc/ (`localhost`) should be replaced on the actual server address.

The Django admin panel is placed by URL http://localhost/admin/
  
#### Initial dataset usage

The site is bundled with a test set of data, which may be installed by the command
```shell
docker exec web python manage.py loaddata fixtures.json
```

#### Stop and remove containers

``shell
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm web
``
 
 Keep in mind, that after the main worker container's removal, the database and some of config files stays in *Docker volumes*. Run the following command for complete removal of all the rest data: `docker volume prune`
 
#### Potential problems

- In some cases any Docker commands result an error docker: `Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at...` and Docker runs correctly only with superuser privileges. To fix the error and allow Docker to launch with rights of current user you shall create `docker` group and add the current user to it:
```shell
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Then you have to terminate current session and login under the current user again to apply the changes (sometimes you may have also to reboot the host).
